# Report Normalizer

This tool standardizes and formats report files using a central configuration spreadsheet.

## How it works

- Reads a configuration file (`Report Normalization.xlsx`)
- Loads a report
- Applies formatting and renaming rules
- Outputs a `_processed.csv` version in the same directory

## To run
python main.py
